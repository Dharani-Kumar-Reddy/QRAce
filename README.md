# QRAce
QRAce is an android application to handle data using QR codes. QR codes are helpful to interact and share information from the physical world to electronic devices within no time. It's main objective is to help the users to procure the power to handle data ranging from small pieces like contact card, email etc. to bulk amount of data using the QR codes. In order to share information both the users need to have this application installed on their device. The user of the app needs to create a profile consisting of name, e-mail, phone and any other basic info if the user wishes. If a user wants to share one’s details to other user, one must open the app to scan the QR code and user must show the QR code corresponding to the detail user wants to share. This app also makes your life easier by displaying the options like call, message, save contact when you scan a mobile number. This basically reduces time taken by user to save contact. Bulk data handling is part of future goal- for example consider a set of phone numbers whom you want to call. In this case you can’t imagine typing every number. So, just upload the excel sheet containing data this app gives QR codes in the selected column. In case of mailing this can’t be of much use.(To scan and generate QR codes I have used Zxing API)
